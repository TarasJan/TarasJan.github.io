## FrontendCon

This week I have had a pleasure of attending my first ever IT conference.

The name of the conference was Frontend Con. It took place in Warsaw and lasted for 2 days.

I decided to share the some of the impressions both good and bad I have experienced there.

If the most important part of the conference for you is networking then, at least from my experience the conference
was a grand failure. The location was splendid, Warsaw's Palace of Culture and Science is the most iconic and one of the most beautiful buildings in the city, but considering the sheer number of people attending and the limited space rented for the conference made networking nearly impossible as you had to be more focused about maneuvering through the crowd all the time to get to and from the lecture halls, not to sit on the stairs of the old cinema in which the conference took place. I have only spoken with a few of fellow craftsmen and no more than a few sentences. 

The catering made up a little bit for the crammed spaces of the conference the food and drinks were plentiful and available to all participants at all times.

However the most important asset and the reason people go to conferences are the talks(or at least they says so). They were equally numerous as attendants and the calories served, however you could at best attend half of them since most of of the time there were at two talks happening simultaneously. So I will only describe a section of a section of the talks from the conference that I had attended. If you had a different experience or know of some other notable talks from the conference, please let me know in the comments.

It is important to note that not every presenter on the conference had some interesting or useful to say. Or if he did, it does not mean that he could present it in an engaging way. I would assume around only 25% of the talks I have attended had both of those qualities.

Below is the compilation of the talks I found the most inspiring and / or memorable:
