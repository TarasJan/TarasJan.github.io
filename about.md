# Hello
My name is Jan Taras. I am a Software Engineer currently employed by Sage. I write web applications in Ruby and Javascript. I am a graduate of Warsaw University of Technology in Automation and Robotics, currently studying Compuser Science at Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology.

In spare time I ride bike across Warsaw, play board games and paint extremely mediocre paintings
