My name is Jan Taras. I am a Software Engineer currently employed by Codequest. I write web applications in Ruby and Javascript and Python. My previous employer was Sage. I am a graduate of Warsaw University of Technology in Automation and Robotics, and have Msc. in Computer Science from Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology.

In spare time I ride bike across Warsaw, play board games and paint extremely mediocre paintings.
