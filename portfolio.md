Aside from commercial work I happen to contribute to open source a little. Samples of my non-commercial work can be found below:

## [Sql Reporter](https://github.com/JanTaras29/sql_reporter)
A tool for generating reports on reduction of SQL performance in Rails app. It works alongside [sql_tracker](https://github.com/steventen/sql_tracker) for diagnosing the queries generared by the Rails app

## [Wordify](https://github.com/TarasJan/wordify)
An Excel add-in for parsing numbers into human readable words in more than 6 languages. It is based on [humango](https://github.com/TarasJan/humango) - a Go library facilitating the same functionality of which I am the author.

## [Wordbag](https://github.com/TarasJan/wordbag)
A simple tool for creating and editing sets of decks for Anki spaced repetition systems

More to come soon...
